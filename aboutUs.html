          <p style="text-indent: 2em">It’s hard to imagine a time when French food was not the avant-garde conglomeration of presentation, taste, refined selection of ingredients and innovative processes that they are globally and almost invariably known for today, just as it is difficult to imagine France pre-Republican, pre-red-blue-and-white, pre-Napoleonic era and the French Revolution. Food itself is an unparalleled media and vessel that stores and expresses the events of history unlike any other material culture, largely due to its inherent necessity but also due to its exclusion from what would be considered explicit culture: namely, literature, art, etc. But just as one might study the French political history and come up with a few ideas about when, where, who, how and why, it is equally important to tackle the similar problems with culinary history. In fact, every historical turning point makes a mark on the material culture, drastic or subtle, that offers historians more insight into how a culture functioned in general: how each intricacy within the social structures, local and national traditions intertwine to make up an identity unlike any other. With as complicated and fascinating a history, and moreover, with as artistically pleasing and internationally renowned a food culture, France is therefore our focus to unravel the complicated yet constantly enlightening relationship between food, cuisine, culture and history. Furthermore, I would venture to argue that the lack of uniformity in scholar’s opinions of or even perspectives on culinary culture and its place in the material history versus in the art world provides a unique window that can exemplify interdisciplinary thinking. As such, taking on the sociological, historical, artistic, anthropological and many more views, we will embark on a journey of gastronomic conventions and adventures!

          <p style="text-indent: 2em">French culinary traditions have stood the test of time; they both represent the culture and traditional values of a single country and embody the condign reputation for exceptional quality the whole European continent strives to achieve. The French cuisine combines the basic need to eat in order to survive and the effortless and chick style of french dining. This term, our group wanted to explore the traditions behind the cuisine in the context of history surrounding France. Important aspects of any tradition, whether it’s the Great Lent initially adopted by the Orthodox Church or Thanksgiving, are its economical causes and effects. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We aim to study specific economical aspects of life in France that would have had different effects on higher and lower social classes and, therefore, the culinary traditions of those classes. The differences in products, the way of their consumption, and their quality can reveal a great deal about the economic factors surrounding those traditions (and whether those factors act as causations or simply correlations). Another aspect of French cuisine we wanted to explore is its uniqueness as an art. Food consumption is such a basic necessity for human life, and yet it has turned into an art form with the growth of mass production and farming. It is also important to note that unlike art forms like architecture (which also arguably deals with a basic necessity, having a roof over one’s head), culinary art caters to necessary needs such as allergies. It would be extremely fun to research peculiarities of culinary traditions and styles of cooking that have been affected by the history of the specific region where those traditions are practiced.

          <p style="text-indent: 2em">From the homey French breads and cheese to the acclaimed Michelin Guide, France celebrates a high status in the culinary world today; however, French national cuisine has not always held such prestige – in fact there was a time when French cooking and gastronomy reinforced regional, class, and cultural separation within the country rather than acting as a unifying symbol. In this blog, we will follow this journey and evolution of French cuisine as it intertwines and essentially becomes inseparable from the French national identity and culture that it once divided.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will divide our survey of French gastronomy into five distinct time periods: the Middle Ages (1300-circ. 1500) where de Taillevant emerged with Le Viandier, the earliest collection of recipes, the Ancien Régime (1500 – mid 1700s) during which differences in regional and societal foods enlarged class differences, the Revolutionary years (mid 1700s-1850s) with the introduction of the haute cuisine, Marie-Antoine Carême’s sauce innovations, Post-industrialization and the twentieth century (1850s-2000) with Georges Auguste Escoffier’s modernization of the preceding period’s haute cuisine, and modern day French cuisine (2000-) with the two standards provide by Guide Michelin and Guide Gault-Millau, with the latter celebrating the new innovations of nouvelle cuisine chefs.
